# MVPSample
A sample project showing the use of MVP in android. This is forked repository. 

Part of learning process of implementing MVP design pattern in android. Thanks to teh Author (Anup Cowkur).

Presented as part of talk by Anup Cowkur at Bangalore Android Users Group: [Wrting Better Android Apps with MVP](http://slides.com/anupcowkur/writing-better-android-apps-with-mvp).

Note :

There is a load more button to fetch the same feed for testing purpose. Ideally you will have a recyclerview scroll listener for pagination. 

This app is for testing purpose only.
